Welcome to the video. We'll be talking about some of the universally accepted styling conventions used in Python.

## Why have a styling convention?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "7538642f22"
```

`@part1`
- Write readable code
- Universally accepted guidelines
- Contributing to Open Source projects
- Abscence of one may cause unnecessary confusion

`@script`
Let us first talk about why they are important in the first place. Every company and open source project require the code to follow certain rules in order to be added to the code repository. They have very strict guidelines over small but critical things like spacing and indentation. 

A few other reasons would be to ensure that the code is readable and follows universally accepted guidelines. Developers believe that the absence of such a system might caused unnecessary confusion

## Introduction to PEP8

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7fc4007769"
```

`@part1`
- Most popular styling guide for Python
- Set of conventions for writing code
- Rules governing 
    - Indentation
    - Formatting
    - Tabs
    - imports
    - Line length & spacing


`@script`
This video is going to talk about PEP8, which is the most famous styling guides among Python developers. It has a detailed set of rules which govern every aspect of writing code. It includes Indentation, formatting, tabs vs. spaces, importing libraries, spacing and line length to name a few. We will be briefly going over a few important categories.


---
## Indentation

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "8aa4cf36fa"
```

`@part1`
- The most common mistake while writing functions
- Continuation lines should align wrapped elements


`@part2`
### Yes
```
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)
```


`@part3`



`@part4`
### No

```
def long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four):
    print(var_one)
```


`@script`
The indentation is one of the most important parts of styling. The indentation makes sure that the code is evenly separated. Also, Python is one of those languages where indentation is compulsory since the syntax of the code depends on it. Without proper indentation the code will throw syntax errors.Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python’s implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent.


---
## Imports 

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "40b9351936"
center_content: false
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
Yes
```
import os
import sys
```
No
```
import os, sys
```
This is okay though:
```
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
```


`@part2`
Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. Standard library imports
2. Related third-party imports
3. Local application/library specific imports


`@script`
Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.

1. Standard library imports
2. Related third-party imports
3. Local application/library specific imports

## Whitespaces

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "32cb4979d9"
```

`@part1`
Yes
```
spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
```
No
```
spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
```


`@part2`
Yes
```
if x == 4: print x, y; x, y = y, x
```
No
```
if x == 4 : print x , y ; x , y = y , x
```


`@script`
Use of appropriate whitespace is recommended to ensure that the code is readable to any other programmer in general. It has multiple rules, like a whitespace around a '='/'+=' or any equivalence symbol in an expression.


---
## Naming conventions.

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "268509fec0"
```

`@part1`
- Steer clear of package and module names, class names, type variables names, exception names, function names etc. 
- **CamelCase**: Use this format to assign long variable names like 'CapitalizedWords'. Simply joining multiple words while retaining the first capital letter. 
- When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.


`@script`
The naming conventions of Python’s library are a bit of a mess, so we’ll never get this completely consistent – nevertheless, here are the currently recommended naming standards. 

Naming conventions are something which people value the most. Using short single letter variables is always troublesome since the reader will not be able to track the variable to its meaning. Also, confusing the default method/variables might lead to some bugs in the code.


---
## Let us style some code?

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "4c35993701"
```

`@script`
Having seen some of the most important styling conventions, let us try and refactor some code by ourselves. In the upcoming exercise, you'll be asked to apply some of the concepts discussed in the video like applying proper indentations, using proper naming conventions, clearing superfluous whitespace etc.
